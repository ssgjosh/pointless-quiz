# POINTLESS CATEGORY DESIGN BRIEFING
## The Definitive Guide to Creating Perfect Family Quiz Categories

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A perfect Pointless category is a **closed, verifiable set** of answers that:
- Contains **15-45 answers** (the "sweet spot")
- Spans **multiple difficulty tiers** (from obvious to obscure)
- Is **culturally resonant** for British families
- Has a **definitive, checkable source** (no subjective interpretation)
- Creates **natural gameplay tension** (everyone knows some, nobody knows all)

---

## PART 1: THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES

### Rule 1: FINITE & VERIFIABLE
Every category MUST have a definitive, closed list that can be verified against an authoritative source.

**YES:** "UK Prime Ministers" (list exists, verifiable)
**NO:** "Famous British People" (subjective, unbounded)

### Rule 2: THE SIZE SWEET SPOT

| Size | Verdict | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1-6 | TOO SMALL | No challenge, everyone gets pointless |
| 7-11 | BORDERLINE | Can work if culturally rich |
| **12-45** | **PERFECT** | Enough variety, natural difficulty spread |
| 46-60 | ACCEPTABLE | Works if naturally tiered |
| 61-100 | CHALLENGING | Must have very clear difficulty tiers |
| 100+ | TOO LARGE | Impossible to survey, feels unfair |

### Rule 3: DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION
A perfect category has answers across ALL difficulty bands:

- **High scores (70-100):** 3-5 "gimme" answers everyone knows
- **Mid-high (50-69):** 5-8 commonly known answers
- **Mid (25-49):** 8-12 "I think I know this" answers
- **Low (10-24):** 5-10 "enthusiast knowledge" answers
- **Very low (1-9):** 3-6 "obscure but fair" answers
- **Pointless (0):** 1-3 legitimate answers almost nobody would say

### Rule 4: CULTURAL RESONANCE
Categories should connect with shared British family knowledge:
- School curriculum topics
- British TV, film, and media
- Geography everyone learned
- Sports with UK following
- Music across generations
- Nostalgic pop culture

### Rule 5: NO SUBJECTIVITY
The question must have OBJECTIVELY correct answers.

**YES:** "Actors who have played James Bond in official EON films"
**NO:** "Best James Bond actors" (opinion)

## PART 3: WHAT TO AVOID

### BANNED CATEGORY TYPES

| Category Type | Why It Fails | Example |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Open-ended professions | Hundreds of valid answers | "Types of Doctor" |
| Subjective lists | No definitive source | "Popular Baby Names" |
| Natural categories | Thousands of species | "Types of Bird" |
| Product categories | Constantly changing | "UK Supermarkets" |
| Chart music (unbounded) | Thousands of hits | "UK Number 1 Singles" |
| Vague geography | Undefined boundaries | "Towns in England" |
| Generic nouns | Infinite answers | "Types of Food" |

### RED FLAGS IN QUESTION WORDING

**AVOID:**
- "Name a..." (implies open set)
- "Types of..." (often unbounded)
- "Famous..." (subjective)
- "Popular..." (opinion-based)
- "Examples of..." (open-ended)

**USE:**
- "Which of the [X] official..."
- "Name one of the [N]..."
- "Characters in..."
- "Countries that..."
- "Winners of..."

## PART 4: CURATED CATEGORY IDEAS

### TIER 1: PERFECT CATEGORIES (15-40 answers, ideal difficulty spread)

| British Monarchs since 1066 | 41 | History curriculum |
| Dickens Novels | 15 | School/cultural |
| Winter Olympic Sports | 15 | Sports, less obvious than summer |

| UK National Parks | 15 | Geography |

### TIER 2: EXCELLENT CATEGORIES (requiring careful framing)

| Category | Count | Framing Needed |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Christmas Number 1s 2000-2023 | 24 | Year-bounded |
| Oscar Best Picture Winners 2000-2024 | 25 | Year-bounded |
| England Football World Cup Squad 2022 | 26 | Specific tournament |
| Books in Narnia Chronicles | 7 | Small but iconic |
| Pixar Feature Films | 28 | Clear studio definition |
| Studio Ghibli Feature Films | 24 | Clear studio definition |
| Planet of the Solar System | 8 | Small but educational |
| Mr Men Characters (Original 43) | 43 | Specify original run |
| Thomas the Tank Engine Characters (Original TV Series) | ~30 | Specify era |
| Only Fools and Horses Main Characters | 12 | Specify main cast |

### TIER 3: USABLE BUT MONITOR (smaller or requires clarity)

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Hogwarts Houses | 4 | Too small alone - combine! |
| Teletubbies | 4 | Too small alone |
| Spice Girls | 5 | Too small alone |
| Seven Dwarfs | 7 | Borderline, iconic |
| Signs of the Zodiac | 12 | Just right threshold |
| Months of the Year in French | 12 | Language twist |
| Rainbow Colours | 7 | Too small alone |
| One Direction Members | 5 | Too small alone |

**COMBINATION STRATEGY:** Bundle small sets into compound categories:
- "Characters from 90s Kids TV" (Teletubbies + others)
- "90s/00s Boyband/Girlband Members" (combine groups)

## PART 5: SCORING PHILOSOPHY

### How to Assign Scores

Scores should reflect **"What percentage of 100 surveyed British adults would give this answer?"**

| Score | Interpretation | Assignment Method |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 85-100 | "Everyone knows this" | First answers in the category |
| 60-84 | "Most people know" | Common knowledge |
| 35-59 | "Many would get" | Requires some familiarity |
| 15-34 | "Enthusiasts know" | Specialist interest |
| 5-14 | "Obscure but gettable" | Deep knowledge |
| 1-4 | "Almost pointless" | Expert level |
| 0 | "Pointless!" | Technically correct, almost unknown |

### Scoring Examples

**James Bond Films:**
- "Skyfall" → 95 (huge hit, recent)
- "GoldenEye" → 75 (very famous)
- "Casino Royale" → 82 (Craig reboot)
- "The Living Daylights" → 35 (Dalton era, less known)
- "Licence to Kill" → 28 (often forgotten)
- "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" → 20 (Lazenby, cult status)
- "Dr. No" → 45 (first one, but old)

**London Boroughs:**
- "Westminster" → 92
- "Camden" → 78
- "Hackney" → 55
- "Barking and Dagenham" → 25
- "Havering" → 12
- "Bexley" → 8

## PART 7: QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before finalising any category, verify:

- [ ] **Finite:** Is there a definitive, countable list?
- [ ] **Verifiable:** Can answers be checked against an authoritative source?
- [ ] **Size:** Does it fall in the 12-50 sweet spot (or 7-60 acceptable range)?
- [ ] **Difficulty spread:** Are there obvious answers AND obscure ones?
- [ ] **Family-friendly:** Appropriate for all ages?
- [ ] **British relevance:** Will a UK family connect with this topic?
- [ ] **Complete:** Have ALL valid answers been included?
- [ ] **Unambiguous:** Is each answer clearly in or out of the set?
- [ ] **Question clarity:** Does the question clearly define the bounds?
- [ ] **Scoring sensible:** Do scores reflect realistic survey results?

## CONCLUSION

The perfect Pointless category feels **fair but challenging**. Players should:
- Immediately think of 2-3 obvious answers
- Struggle to think of more
- Kick themselves when obscure answers are revealed
- Feel satisfied that every answer was legitimate and checkable

**The goal:** Create that authentic Pointless moment where everyone groans "Oh! I should have said that!"

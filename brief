Goal

Build a TV-friendly quiz game where players aim to give a correct answer with the lowest score. Scores are generated from real public data so they’re “genuine”, not made up.

Target audience

A small group playing in a living room. Must be:

easy to read from a sofa

easy to host (keyboard + big on-screen buttons)

simple English (“category + give an answer”)

1) Core game rules (party-friendly “Pointless style”)
Game mode: Party mode (no elimination)

Supports 5 players (or 2 teams + host).

Everyone answers each round.

Lowest total score at the end wins.

Scoring

Correct answers score 0–100, where 0 is best (“pointless”), higher is worse.

Wrong / not in list / repeated / time-out = 100.

Rounds

Default: 10 rounds (configurable 5–20).

Each round:

show a category prompt (“Name a US state”, “Name a country in the EU”, etc.)

each player gives 1 answer

reveal score + optional image

update leaderboard

Optional “Final”

A final round where each player gives 3 answers from one category; their final score is the best (lowest) one or the sum of the three (toggle).

2) Data requirements: genuinely public + automatically generated
Approved data sources

Use these, and build the game around them:

Wikidata (WDQS SPARQL) for category lists (answers, aliases, IDs, etc.). 
Wikidata

Wikimedia Commons images via Wikidata (prefer Wikidata image properties like P18, flags, etc.). 
Wikidata

Wikipedia/Wikimedia pageviews to compute a real popularity score. 
Wikimedia Open Source

MediaWiki API imageinfo to fetch image URLs + metadata needed for attribution (including extmetadata). 
MediaWiki
+1

Only use Commons media (it’s free-licensed content; no fair use). 
Wikimedia Commons

Data pipeline (important: do this as a “pack builder”)

Do not call APIs constantly during gameplay. Instead:

Provide a pack builder CLI that generates a pack.json from category definitions.

The pack builder:

runs SPARQL to get the allowed answers for each category

fetches pageviews (or another public metric)

assigns points 0–100

fetches an image per answer when available

stores image URL + attribution text + licence info in the pack

Result: the game runs smoothly even if Wi‑Fi is flaky.

3) How to compute “Pointless” scores from real data
Default scoring metric: Wikipedia pageviews (real numbers)

For each answer item:

find its English Wikipedia article title (if present)

fetch pageviews for a fixed window (e.g. last 365 days or last 90 days)

compute popularity from total views

Then map to points:

Let pop = log10(pageviews + 1) (log avoids mega-famous items flattening everything)

Normalise within the category:

norm = (pop - minPop) / (maxPop - minPop) (handle edge cases)

Points = round(norm * 100)

This makes the least-viewed item(s) land near 0, most-viewed near 100.

Make “pointless answers” common (so it feels right)

Add a rule:

any answer in the bottom 10% of popularity => 0 points
This creates multiple 0s like the show.

Fallback metric (if pageviews not available)

If there’s no Wikipedia article:

use Wikidata sitelinks count (or mark as “low confidence” and set points based on rank).
(Implementation detail: can be fetched in SPARQL, avoids extra API calls.)

4) Images: automatic, licensed, and credited
Image selection strategy

For each answer, try in this order (configurable per category):

flag image / coat of arms / locator map properties when relevant (countries, regions)

image (P18) as general fallback 
Wikidata

Getting a usable image URL

Take the Commons filename from Wikidata

Call MediaWiki action=query&prop=imageinfo&iiprop=url|extmetadata to get:

a direct URL / thumbnail URL

author/credit/licence fields needed for attribution 
MediaWiki
+1

Attribution (must be built-in)

Add an “Info / Credits” overlay in-game:

shows the licence + author credit for any image used

shows a pack-level credits screen at the end

Commons content is free-licensed, but you still have to follow the licence terms (attribution etc.). 
Wikimedia Commons

5) UI/UX: TV-first, “proper quiz show” feel, but original
Look and feel

Original styling inspired by a modern quiz board:

large category title

huge score reveal

clean leaderboard

No copying the real show’s layout 1:1. Keep it “quiz night”, not a clone.

Animations

Must include:

category intro animation (1–2 seconds)

“thinking” state (subtle pulsing timer bar)

score reveal animation (counting up/down effect)

special animation for 0 points (small celebration / confetti / glow)

optional “reduce motion” toggle

Sound effects

Must have: correct, wrong (100), “pointless” (0), round start, round end

Must have mute + volume slider

Only use:

CC0 / CC-BY sounds (with attribution if needed) — e.g. Freesound explains attribution expectations for their CC licences 
Freesound

OR BBC Sound Effects only for personal/non-commercial use (party night is fine; don’t ship commercially). Third-party reporting describes the Rem moderated archive licence as personal/educational/research only. 
Mixmag

Also: audio must only play after a user gesture (browser autoplay rules).

6) Hosting controls (make it dead easy)
Host view (single laptop screen)

Big “Next player” button

Input box for answer

Autocomplete dropdown:

as host types, show best matches from the allowed answers list (including aliases)

host clicks to confirm the intended answer (avoids spelling arguments)

Keyboard shortcuts

→ next player

Enter confirm answer

Backspace undo last reveal

N next round

M mute

F fullscreen

7) Pack format: easy to add more data
Category definitions (authoring format)

People should be able to add a category with:

a title

a prompt

a SPARQL query OR a manual list

image preferences

scoring window (90d/365d) and “0% threshold”

Use a simple YAML format like:

title: "Pointless Night Pack (UK-ish)"
version: 1
categories:
  - id: eu_countries
    prompt: "Name a country in the European Union"
    sparql: |
      SELECT ?item ?itemLabel (COALESCE(?flag, ?img) AS ?image) ?article WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P463 wd:Q458.
        OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P41 ?flag. }
        OPTIONAL { ?item wdt:P18 ?img. }
        OPTIONAL { ?article schema:about ?item; schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>. }
        SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
      }
    scoring:
      metric: "wikipedia_pageviews"
      window_days: 365
      pointless_percentile: 10
    images:
      enabled: true
      thumb_width: 800


The pack builder turns that into a runtime pack.json with:

answers[] entries (canonical text + aliases + points + image + attribution)

validation hashes so results are reproducible

8) Deliverables

Notes on “real Pointless data”

If you mean “use actual boards from the TV show”: fan sites do exist that list questions/answers/scores. 
pointlessarchive.blogspot.com

But that content is still almost certainly owned by the producers/BBC. For a private one-off at home, you can manually type in what you’ve seen on TV, but I would not build an automated importer/scraper or publish/share packs that reproduce show boards.

If you want, I can also give you

10–15 ready-made SPARQL category definitions that work well and tend to have images (flags, animals, landmarks, etc.), tuned for “UK living room” difficulty.
